                    Explore the fascinating world of mathematical fractals - geometric figures with patterns 
                    that repeat infinitely at different scales. These self-similar structures appear throughout 
                    nature and have applications in mathematics, computer science, and art.

                    <strong>Note:</strong> Unlike sorting and pathfinding, fractals are not algorithms themselves but rather mathematical objects or patterns. 
                    However, they are typically generated using algorithms, often recursive ones, making them an interesting complement to algorithmic visualizations.

                                The Pythagoras Tree is a geometric fractal built from squares. Starting with an initial square,
                                two smaller squares are positioned on one of its sides, creating a structure resembling a tree.

                        Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales.
                        They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.
                        Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos.

                        Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely 
                        familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, ferns, clouds, snowflakes, 
                        mountains, lightning bolts, and even our own circulatory systems.

                        In computing, fractals have revolutionized image compression technology and computer graphics.
                        They've also helped describe the behavior of chaotic systems like weather patterns and stock market fluctuations.

                        The algorithms behind fractals often involve simple mathematical formulas repeated in feedback loops,
                        demonstrating how complexity can emerge from simplicity through iteration.
